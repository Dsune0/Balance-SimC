1. What's new? <a href="https://github.com/balance-simc/Balance-SimC/commits/master/faq.txt" target="_top">(changelog)</a>
    * All sims are updated for Shadowlands with the latest hotfixes!
    * NEW LAYOUT! All combinations of covenants, legendaries, soulbinds, conduits, traits, and talents are available. You can drag & drop to adjust the layout, filters, and chart displays however you want.
    * Use the [Report Issue](https://github.com/balance-simc/Balance-SimC/issues/new/choose) link for any issues/questions/suggestions.

1. How do I use the new charts?
    * The main sims page on [Dreamgrove](https://dreamgrove.gg/sims) has brief instructions on how to use various parts of the chart to look at the information you want.

1. What are the base profiles used in the sims?
    * All raid buffs and consumables are used.
    * 'Smart Sim' setting is used for each set of talents with a fixed covenant & legendary. This means that for each covenant & legendary combo, the talents that sim highest will be more accurate than the talents that sim the lowest.
    * Full 6 mastery gems are socketted and all available enchants are applied.
    * The base character can be found in [sandbag.txt](sandbag.txt).
        - All items are from Mythic Castle Nathria, except for Inscrutable Quantum Device, which is a Great Vault item.
        - Legendary items are set to ilevel 235 with Haste & Mastery.
        - All soulbinds are fully unlocked.
        - All conduits are at Rank 7.

1. What is the '1T Move' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an approximation of a light movement encounter. The simc raid_events can be found in [move.txt](move.txt). It consists of:
        * Each movement has a random distance of 20yd to 30yd
        * Movement starts when boss health reaches 95%
        * Movement repeats every ~30s to ~60s
    * There is no optimization of pooling and planning for movement
    * Fallback casts during movement are:
        * Starsurge if Balance of All Things is not equipped
        * Sunfire and Moonfire, starting with the lowest remaining duration

2. What is the '2T Spread' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This represents an encounter with two targets which are by 15 yards so Starfire and Moonfire /w Twin Moons talent cannot hit both targets at the same time.

1. What is the 'Composite' selection in the target dropdown?
    * This is an ***UNOPTIMIZED, VERY CRUDE APPROXIMATION*** of a random highly variable encounter as often found in dungeons. The simc raid_events can be found in [composite.txt](composite.txt). It consists of:
        * Random light movement as per the '1T Move' script
        * ~550s total fight time
        * ~130s to ~150s fighting one mob
        * ~30s to ~50s fighting a wave of 3 to 7 mobs, each wave random and repeating until the end of the fight
        * Random ~10s to ~30s wait after each fight

1. How does SimC handle Convoke the Spirits (Night Fae)?
    * Convoke the Spirits will cast:
        - 5 to 6 heals
        - 20% chance to replace a damage spell with Full Moon
        - Strong likelihood of casting 3-5 starsurges
        - Almost guaranteed chance to cast starfall if it isn't up
        - Chance to cast Moonfire on an un-dotted target

1. How does SimC handle Kindred Spirits (Kyrian)?
    * SimC makes the following assumptions:
        - You are bonding with someone who does the exact same damage as you
        - 20% of the pool is lost from taking damage
        - The additional damage done by you AND your partner are attributed to you
    
1. What about bugs on the Beta/PTR? Which are assumed to be fixed for the sims?
    * The following bugs are present in the game but NOT in SimC
        - Adaptive Swarm will not jump onto an ally that already has a Swarm and will fizzle if there are no other friendly targets.

1. Are the sims updated for _____ ?
